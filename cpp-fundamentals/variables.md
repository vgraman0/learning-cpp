- C++ is strongly typed:
    - Variables can only hold a certain type of value.
    - Must declare a variable before it is used.
    - "The compiler is your friend"
- Fundamental types:
    - Numbers, boolean, single characters
- User defined types
    - Strings, dates, business objects
    - Structs and classes
